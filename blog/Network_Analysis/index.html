	<h3>What is a network?</h3>

	<p class="indent">
		Networks have become a standard tool for analyzing the relationships/interactions between the components of a complex system. When it comes to understanding and modeling certain 
		systems, like <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/network-analysis-protein-interaction-data-introduction/protein-protein-interaction-networks">protein-protein interactions</a>
		or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_regulatory_network">gene regulatory networks</a>, it becomes apparent that these systems portray non-linear behavior and are simply 
		too complex to model with a simple mathematical equation. 
	</p>

	<p class="indent">
		By utilizing a branch of mathematics known as graph theory, we can produce simple visual representations of these kinds of systems by treating the components of the system as 
		vertices and the relationships between them as edges.

		The network above represents the character relationship mapping for the TV show <i>Lost</i>. Used this infographic.

	<h3>Introduction to Centrality Measurements</h3>

	<p class="indent">
		What is centrality. We will be discussing a few different types.
	</p>

	<h4>Degree Centrality</h4>

	<p class="indent">
		Out of all of the centrality measurements that there are, degree centrality is probably the easiest to understand. In graph theory, the <i>degree</i> of a node is simply the number
		of edges that connect to it. For example, the node "Jacob" has a degree of 7, while "Kate Austen" has a degree of 4. 
	</p>

	<h4>Betweeness Centrality</h4>

	<h4>Eigenvector Centrality</h4>
