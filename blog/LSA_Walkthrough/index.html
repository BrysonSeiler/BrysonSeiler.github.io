        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis">Latent Semantic Analysis</a> (LSA) is a mathematical model that provides us with a way to rigorously define 
        the similarities between bodies of text based on the frequencies at which words appear inside of them. This post will walk through an example of how Latent Semantic Analysis
        can be used to group similar documents with each other.

        For the sake of providing an example that is easy to understand, I have produced the following documents to make up our corpus:

        If we were asked to categorize these documents, it's evident that we could put the first two documents into the same category and the
        third and fourth documents into a different category, let's call them <i>pets</i> and <i>travel</i>.

        This is a rather trivial conclusion that can be drawn for a human, but how can we make a computer recognize these patterns? One technique would be to look at the frequencies at 
        which words appear in each document and group together the documents that use the same words frequently. For example, we can see that documents 1 and 2 both use the words pets, cats, 
        and dogs very frequently, hence it may be reasonable to assume that documents 1 and 2 belong in the same group.
