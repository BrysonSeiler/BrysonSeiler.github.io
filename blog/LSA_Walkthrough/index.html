        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis">Latent Semantic Analysis</a> (LSA) is a mathematical model that provides us with a way to rigorously define 
        the similarities between bodies of text based on the frequencies at which words appear inside of them. This post will walk through an example of how Latent Semantic Analysis
        can be used to group similar documents with each other.

        Suppose that the following four, contrived, documents make up our corpus:

        If we were asked to categorize these documents, it's evident that we could put the first two documents into the same category and the
        third and fourth documents into a different category, let's call them <i>pets</i> and <i>travel</i>.

        This is a rather trivial conclusion for a human, but how can we make a computer recognize these patterns? One technique would be to look at the frequencies at 
        which words appear in each document and group together the documents that use the same words frequently. For example, we can see that documents 1 and 2 both use the words <i>pets</i>, <i>cats</i>, 
        and <i>dogs</i> very frequently, hence it may be reasonable to assume that documents 1 and 2 belong in the same group.

        To quantify this idea, it is common practice to convert a corpus into what is known as a <i>document-term</i> frequency matrix. Each row of this matrix represents a document 
        in the corpus and each column represents a unique word inside of the documents. By letting each entry of the matrix represent the frequency at which a word appears inside of 
        a document, we can begin to quantify the similarity of documents.

        The heatmap above represents the document-term frequency matrix for our corpus. As we can see, it is starting to become more clear which documents are related to eachother, but we can
        do better.
