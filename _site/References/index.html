                activities at Math Club and an independent research project.  Also, I have observed the posters that he has made for the Department of Mathematics Poster Sessions at the end 
                of each semester. Bryson is able to combine analytical thinking with a creative approach to problem solving.  He has taken and done very well in a breadth of courses in mathematics, statistics, 
                and computing.  His communication skills, observed at poster sessions, are also superb.  Bryson is very friendly and collaborative and gets along well with his fellow students.  
                I recommend him very highly."

                "As a student majoring in Applied Mathematics at Colorado State University, Bryson Seiler has shown a great aptitude for applying mathematical theory to real-world problems. 
                In Spring 2017 Bryson took my class Math 435, Projects in Applied Mathematics. Bryson conducted a project on modeling centrality in networks (such as social or transportation 
                networks) using spectral (eigenvalue and eigenvector) techniques. Along the way, Bryson also implemented Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for shortest graphs, and how to embed graphs in 
                the plane (for the purpose of visualization). Bryson is comfortable using rigorous mathematical tools in real-world data analysis. Furthermore, Bryson is a talented expositor 
                (both in writing and in oral presentation), who is able to clearly explain his ideas to mathematicians and non-mathematicians alike. It was therefore no surprise when Bryson 
                was a poster prize winner for the Fall 2017 Colorado State University Mathematics Poster Session, for his project on 'Dissecting any polygon into a square'." <br/><br/>

                "In Fall 2016 took my class Math 301, Introduction to Combinatorial Theory. This class is a proof-based introduction to combinatorics, including recurrence relations, generating 
                functions, cryptography, Euler's formula for polyhedra and planar graphs, graph colorings, and minimal spanning trees. This training in proof-based mathematics will serve Bryson 
                well in scientific, engineering, and programming tasks where evidence-based arguments are required."
