    <h2>Subreddit Analysis</h2>

    <p class="indent">
        Reddit is one of my favorite websites to waste time on. If you aren’t familiar, Reddit is a bulletin board style website where you can share interesting links, pictures, posts, 
        etc. with other people. To help organize what you share, you are asked to decide which <i>subreddit</i> you would like to post the information to. A subreddit is simply a 
        community within the website where you can only post information that pertains to the topic of the subreddit. There are thousands of subreddits ranging from politics to tv show fanbases. 
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
        If you browse through reddit enough, you may start to notice that you can often read the title of a post and guess which subreddit it came from. This is due to the fact that each
        subreddit typically has its own unique set of verbage. Political subreddits will typically use words like ... while subreddits that focus on tv shows will often use the names of the 
        characters in the show frequently.

        This made me wonder, <i>can I write a program that is able to differentiate between subreddits strictly based off of the verbage that is used in post titles?</i>
    </p>

    <h3>Gathering and Processing Submission Titles From Reddit</h3>

    <p class="indent">
        To gather submission titles from Reddit, I used a Python package called <a href="https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PRAW</a> (Python Reddit API Wrapper). PRAW allows for 
        simple access to Reddit's API. It's easy to use and allows you to gather up to 1000 submission titles (per subreddit) at once.
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
        For this project, I decided to keep it simple and only gather 1000 submission titles from the Westworld, Doctor Who, and Game of Thrones subreddits. 
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
        While gathering submission titles, I filtered out all special characters along with stop words to make it easier to process the data when we do LSA. I combined both of the nltk
        and sklearn stopwords lists. Here is a sample of the program filtering the submission titles:
    </p>

<b>Submission title:</b> Everything you feel is true. Ed Harris has been nominated for “Outstanding Lead Actor in 
                  a Drama Series” at this year’s Emmys.

<b>Submission title:</b> Reading the Emmy nominations and not seeing anything for the true star of season 2.
