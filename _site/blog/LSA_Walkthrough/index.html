        Within the realm of natural language processing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis">Latent Semantic Analysis</a> (LSA) is a method that we use to 
        analyze the relationships between a set of documents (a <i>corpus</i>) and the words that they contain. In this post, we will be taking an in-depth look at LSA by showing how 
        this technique can be used to categorize a set of documents.

        To begin, letâ€™s suppose that your boss asked you read through the following documents and then sort them into two different categories.

        After reading through these documents, it's easy to see that the first two could fall under the same category lets say <i>pets</i> and that the third and fourth documents could 
        belong to a different category, lets call it <i>travel</i>.

        This is a rather trivial conclusion for a human, but how can we make a computer recognize these patterns? One technique would be to look at the frequencies at 
        which words appear in each document and group together the documents that use the same words frequently. For example, we can see that documents 1 and 2 both use the words <i>pets</i>, <i>cats</i>, 
        and <i>dogs</i> very frequently, hence it may be reasonable to assume that documents 1 and 2 belong in the same group.

        To quantify this idea, it is common practice to convert a corpus into what is known as a <i>document-term</i> frequency matrix. Each row of this matrix represents a document 
        in the corpus and each column represents a unique word inside of the documents. By letting each entry of the matrix represent the frequency at which a word appears inside of 
        a document, we can begin to quantify the similarity of documents.

        The heatmap above represents the document-term frequency matrix for our corpus. With this representation, we can see not only what words appeared most frquently inside of these documents,
        but we can also see which documents used the same words most frequently together.
