	<h1>Network Analysis</h1>

	<p class="indent">
		Everyone knows about social networks like twitter, facebook, and linkedin, but there are many other types of networks that people don't often think about. Airports, financial 
		institutions and governments are just a few examples of networks whose connections arise based off of different sets of rules than that of a social network. In the most general 
		sense, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory">network</a> is a system of interconnected objects. These objects can be anything, but for it to be a network, 
		these objects need to interact with each other in some fashion. Networks arise in many disciplines and understanding them is of utmost importance. With a branch of mathematics known as graph theory, we can get a better understanding of these networks.
	</p>

	<p class="indent">
		A  is a convinent way to model the relationships between the components that make up a system. An intuitive example of a network
		is a <i>social network</i>, like the one thjat I have depicted above. This social network models the relationships between each of the characters in the T.V. show <i>Lost</i> which I 
		based off of this <a href="https://jezebel.com/5523029/lost-the-complete-character-web">infographic</a>. Essentially, if any two characters are connected, it means that they had some
		sort of relationship within the show, whether that be romantic, knew eachother before the island, etc.
	</p>

	
	

	<p class="indent">
		Networks have become a standard tool for analyzing the relationships/interactions between the components of a complex system. When it comes to understanding and modeling certain 
		systems, like <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/network-analysis-protein-interaction-data-introduction/protein-protein-interaction-networks">protein-protein interactions</a>
		or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_regulatory_network">gene regulatory networks</a>, it becomes apparent that these systems portray non-linear behavior and are simply 
		too complex to model with a simple mathematical equation. 
	</p>

	<p class="indent">
		By utilizing a branch of mathematics known as graph theory, we can produce simple visual representations of these kinds of systems by treating the components of the system as 
		vertices and the relationships between them as edges.
