        My name is Bryson Seiler and I am an aspiring Data Scientist from Durango, Colorado with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and a minor in Applied Statistics. 
        As an undergraduate, I gained experience analyzing data with a variety of modeling techniques such as linear/non-linear regression, classification (logistic regression/discriminant analysis), 
        dimension reduction, and some unsupervised learning techniques like PCA and k-means clustering. While I'm a mathematician by trade, I also spend a lot 
        of time programming in languages like Python, Java and R for many of my side projects which have been outlined on this website that I've built from the ground up.
